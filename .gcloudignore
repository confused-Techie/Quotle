In this case, a .gcloudignore file would help by preventing the upload of any file or directory. The syntax is the same as the .gitignore file.

First you could make sure gcloudignore is enabled:

gcloud config list
If it is not, then you may enable it:

gcloud config set gcloudignore/enabled true
Some gcloud commands like gcloud functions deploy may automatically generate a .gcloudignore file.

The .gcloudignore file must reside in the project root folder.

Here is the .gcloudignore that is automatically generated by the gcloud function deploy command:

# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
